Day 1
<br>
My first day at GNDEC started with all the CSE and IT students assembling in the auditorium. The atmosphere was calm, and the stage was beautifully decorated. After waiting for about 30 minutes, the host invited the first speaker, Harpreet Mam. Her lecture made us feel like we were already a part of the GNDEC family.

Our Principal Sir then motivated us to make the best use of this platform. The NSET Director introduced us to the illustrious history of this institution, emphasizing its 68 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

I learned an essential lesson: “Seize the opportunity; don’t wait for it to come to you.”

Next, the ADGP Officer shared invaluable insights about karma and the delayed rewards of good deeds. He spoke from experience for about an hour without any preparation, which was impressive. One piece of advice that stood out was: “Don’t be easily impressed; there’s always more to learn.”

Students who interacted and spoke up received chocolates. In the end, I missed out on chocolates but gained countless lessons, some the hard way. I resolved never to miss an opportunity again.

Day2
<br>
A new opportunity arose thanks to Dr. Arvind Dhingra. He helped me shed my reserved behavior and start interacting with others. He asked for 11 boys and 11 girls to come up on stage. Determined not to miss any opportunity, I joined them. We played a team strategy game and introduced ourselves to our peers.

Then, Dr. H.S. Rai, the Controller of Examination, spoke. His perspective on examinations was fascinating, viewing them as opportunities to shine.

Unexpectedly, Dr. H.S. Rai sought 10 students to work with him – not for him. I felt it was divine intervention when I got selected to be part of this group, which eventually grew to 50 members. From the second day of college, we began learning the latest technologies, an opportunity rarely seen elsewhere.

Day 3 Universal Human Values, Canva Insights, and CodeGNE Leadership
Today marked the third day of my college journey, and it was packed with learning, interaction, and leadership.

Universal Human Values: A Path to Happiness
Our first lecture of the day was on Universal Human Values, a subject that delves into the essence of what it means to live a fulfilling and content life. We explored the concept of happiness and the state of contentment, discussing how these states of mind influence our everyday actions and decisions. The session was enlightening, providing a fresh perspective on how we can achieve true happiness. We also shared real-life scenarios, which made the discussion more relatable and impactful.

Canva: Unlocking Creative Potential
After a refreshing break, we engaged in a peer interaction session where our seniors introduced us to Canva. Canva is a powerful tool for creating visually appealing designs, and the seniors did an excellent job explaining its features and potential uses. From designing posters to creating social media graphics, Canva offers a versatile platform for expressing creativity. This session was particularly beneficial for those of us looking to enhance our presentation and design skills.

CodeGNE Leadership: Empowering the Team
The day concluded with a leadership activity as part of my role in CodeGNE. As a leader, I, along with other group leaders, hosted a doubt session for our group members. This session was aimed at addressing any questions or concerns the members had regarding their projects and tasks. It was a rewarding experience to assist my peers, reinforcing the collaborative spirit of CodeGNE. Helping others not only solidified my understanding of the topics but also fostered a sense of community and support within our group.

Reflections
Today's experiences highlighted the importance of values, creativity, and leadership in our academic and personal growth.

The Canva session unlocked new creative avenues, and the doubt session reinforced the significance of teamwork and guidance.

As I continue my journey, I am excited to apply these insights to my studies and extracurricular activities. Each day brings new opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute, and I am eager to embrace them all.

We learned Excel and ChatGPT in an exciting, hands-on class workshop organized by the Causmic Club. Instead of making a normal Excel sheet and performing calculations manually, we tried to do it with commands. I enjoyed it so much that I gave a video feedback after the lecture.

Later, we had a math session. Initially, recalling all the formulas was challenging, but I eventually got the hang of it and enjoyed the class. Our lecturer, a young assistant professor, was interactive and understanding.

Some of us attended a meeting of the CodeGNE club, a group that had grown to 50 members on Telegram.

Day 6: Exploring Human Values, Canva, and Improvisation Skills
Day 6 of our induction program was packed with insightful lectures and practical activities, offering a blend of philosophical understanding and hands-on learning.

Morning: Universal Human Values (UHV)
Our day began with a lecture on Universal Human Values (UHV). The session delved into the coexistence of the Self and Body, highlighting their distinct needs:

The Self seeks happiness, driven by desires, thoughts, and expectations. These activities are continuous and revolve around knowing, assuming, recognizing, and fulfilling.
The Body requires physical facilities such as food and other material needs, which are temporary and involve recognizing and fulfilling immediate needs.
We learned that the Self, as a Consciousness Entity, and the Body, as a Material Entity, have different types of needs. Misunderstanding these differences can lead to feelings of deprivation and exploitation. Imagination, driven by sensation, pre-conditioning, or natural acceptance, plays a crucial role in the Self. Harmony in the Self is achieved when imagination aligns with natural acceptance, and this harmony is reflected in the Body’s well-being through self-regulation.

Midday: Introduction to Canva
In the second lecture of the day, our seniors introduced us to Canva, a versatile design tool. We were guided through the basics of the platform and created our first template. This hands-on experience was both creative and educational, providing us with practical skills for designing visually appealing content.

Afternoon: CodeGNE Meeting on Improvisation
Later, we attended a CodeGNE meeting focused on improvisation. The session was centered on strategies and techniques to enhance problem-solving skills and adaptability. We explored various methods to think on our feet and make effective decisions in dynamic situations. The insights gained were valuable for improving our ability to handle unexpected challenges and make informed choices.

Technical Learnings and Challenges
Today's journey in CodeGNE has been a treasure trove of technical knowledge. Here are some key learnings and challenges I encountered:

Mastering GitHub: Operating GitHub properly has been a game-changer. From version control to collaborative coding, GitHub has streamlined our workflow and enhanced our productivity.

Markdown Language: Learning Markdown has been incredibly useful. It has simplified the process of formatting text, creating documentation, and maintaining readability across various platforms.

Pandoc Installation and Usage: One of the more challenging yet fulfilling experiences was installing and using Pandoc. Despite facing initial difficulties, I was able to overcome them through perseverance and self-learning.

Helping Others: Being in a leadership position has taught me the importance of helping others complete their work. This not only fosters a collaborative environment but also enhances my understanding of the concepts as I explain them to others.

Upscaling Project Management Skills
Leadership is not just about guiding others but also about continuous self-improvement. My role in CodeGNE has allowed me to refine my project management skills. Coordinating tasks, setting deadlines, and ensuring that the team stays on track are essential aspects of effective leadership that I am continually learning and implementing.

Day 6 at CodeGNE has been transformative. It has provided me with a platform to hone my technical skills, embrace leadership responsibilities, and overcome challenges with determination. I am excited to continue this journey, leveraging my newfound skills to contribute effectively to my team and future projects.

With each step, I am becoming more confident in my abilities and more enthusiastic about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in the field of computer science and engineering.

Day 7 of the Induction Program : A Day of Inspiration and Learning
A Journey of Inspiration with Prof. Harpal Singh Pannu
Our seventh day of the induction program began in the auditorium with an inspiring session by Prof. Harpal Singh Pannu. He shared the story of his childhood, his struggles, and the intriguing tale behind his name. His journey was not just a narrative but a source of inspiration, reminding us of the resilience and determination required to overcome life's challenges. Prof. Pannu also shared various Sakhis of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, which were both enlightening and thought-provoking, offering us valuable life lessons.

Understanding Relationships through Universal Human Values
Following Prof. Pannu's session, we attended a lecture on Universal Human Values (UHV), which focused on understanding the essence of relationships. The key takeaway was that relationships are not merely interactions but connections between two selves. We learned about the nine feelings that form the foundation of any relationship: Trust, Respect, Affection, Care, Guidance, Reverence, Glory, Gratitude, and Complete Love. This session provided profound insights into how we perceive and nurture our relationships.

The Benefits of Joining the National Cadet Corps (NCC)
After the UHV session, we regrouped in the auditorium for a talk by Dr. Harwinder Singh, ANO of the NCC. He introduced us to the myriad benefits of joining the NCC, emphasizing the development of physical fitness, mental strength, personality enhancement, and leadership skills. The NCC not only prepares students for potential careers in the armed forces but also instills invaluable life skills such as discipline, teamwork, and communication. Notable benefits include the Sahara Scholarship for NCC cadets, government-covered expenses for uniforms and camps, and opportunities for selection in the armed forces through NDA.

Serving the Community with the National Service Scheme (NSS)
The day concluded with a session by Dr. Jasvir Singh Grewal, the coordinator of the NSS, who outlined the noble goals and activities of the NSS society at our college. The NSS aims to engage students in community service, focusing on afforestation, AIDS awareness, blood donation camps, environmental cleanliness, and disaster management. Participation in NSS offers numerous benefits, including personality development, preferential treatment in admissions and employment, and opportunities to engage in national integration camps and adventure programs. Through these activities, students develop leadership qualities, a democratic attitude, and a deep sense of involvement in nation-building.

Reflections and Takeaways
Day 7 of the induction program was a day of learning, inspiration, and personal growth. The stories shared, values discussed, and opportunities presented have given us much to reflect upon as we continue our journey through this induction program. Whether it's through understanding the depth of relationships, embracing the discipline and skills of the NCC, or committing to community service with the NSS, we are encouraged to grow into well-rounded individuals.
