Day 1
<br>
My first day at GNDEC started with all the CSE and IT students assembling in the auditorium. The atmosphere was calm, and the stage was beautifully decorated. After waiting for about 30 minutes, the host invited the first speaker, Harpreet Mam. Her lecture made us feel like we were already a part of the GNDEC family.

Our Principal Sir then motivated us to make the best use of this platform. The NSET Director introduced us to the illustrious history of this institution, emphasizing its 68 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

I learned an essential lesson: “Seize the opportunity; don’t wait for it to come to you.”

Next, the ADGP Officer shared invaluable insights about karma and the delayed rewards of good deeds. He spoke from experience for about an hour without any preparation, which was impressive. One piece of advice that stood out was: “Don’t be easily impressed; there’s always more to learn.”

Students who interacted and spoke up received chocolates. In the end, I missed out on chocolates but gained countless lessons, some the hard way. I resolved never to miss an opportunity again.

Day2

A new opportunity arose thanks to Dr. Arvind Dhingra. He helped me shed my reserved behavior and start interacting with others. He asked for 11 boys and 11 girls to come up on stage. Determined not to miss any opportunity, I joined them. We played a team strategy game and introduced ourselves to our peers.

Then, Dr. H.S. Rai, the Controller of Examination, spoke. His perspective on examinations was fascinating, viewing them as opportunities to shine.

Unexpectedly, Dr. H.S. Rai sought 10 students to work with him – not for him. I felt it was divine intervention when I got selected to be part of this group, which eventually grew to 50 members. From the second day of college, we began learning the latest technologies, an opportunity rarely seen elsewhere.

Day3
Day 3 Universal Human Values, Canva Insights, and CodeGNE Leadership
Today marked the third day of my college journey, and it was packed with learning, interaction, and leadership.

Universal Human Values: A Path to Happiness
Our first lecture of the day was on Universal Human Values, a subject that delves into the essence of what it means to live a fulfilling and content life. We explored the concept of happiness and the state of contentment, discussing how these states of mind influence our everyday actions and decisions. The session was enlightening, providing a fresh perspective on how we can achieve true happiness. We also shared real-life scenarios, which made the discussion more relatable and impactful.

Canva: Unlocking Creative Potential
After a refreshing break, we engaged in a peer interaction session where our seniors introduced us to Canva. Canva is a powerful tool for creating visually appealing designs, and the seniors did an excellent job explaining its features and potential uses. From designing posters to creating social media graphics, Canva offers a versatile platform for expressing creativity. This session was particularly beneficial for those of us looking to enhance our presentation and design skills.

CodeGNE Leadership: Empowering the Team
The day concluded with a leadership activity as part of my role in CodeGNE. As a leader, I, along with other group leaders, hosted a doubt session for our group members. This session was aimed at addressing any questions or concerns the members had regarding their projects and tasks. It was a rewarding experience to assist my peers, reinforcing the collaborative spirit of CodeGNE. Helping others not only solidified my understanding of the topics but also fostered a sense of community and support within our group.

Reflections
Today's experiences highlighted the importance of values, creativity, and leadership in our academic and personal growth. The lecture on Universal Human Values reminded me that happiness and contentment are pivotal in shaping our lives. The Canva session unlocked new creative avenues, and the doubt session reinforced the significance of teamwork and guidance.

As I continue my journey, I am excited to apply these insights to my studies and extracurricular activities. Each day brings new opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute, and I am eager to embrace them all.

We learned Excel and ChatGPT in an exciting, hands-on class workshop organized by the Causmic Club. Instead of making a normal Excel sheet and performing calculations manually, we tried to do it with commands. I enjoyed it so much that I gave a video feedback after the lecture.

Later, we had a math session. Initially, recalling all the formulas was challenging, but I eventually got the hang of it and enjoyed the class. Our lecturer, a young assistant professor, was interactive and understanding.

Some of us attended a meeting of the CodeGNE club, a group that had grown to 50 members on Telegram.
